Here is where you can write your post content.

All markdown is supported, including [links](https://example.com), **bold**, *italic*, and `code`.

Find out more about MDC syntax [in the Nuxt Content documentation](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown).

## Headings

By default, headings will generate a table of contents at the top of the page.
You can disable this behavior by setting `tableOfContents: false` in the blog config.
